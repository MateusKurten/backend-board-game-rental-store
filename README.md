# Board Game Rental Website

This application was developed by Mateus Kürten Rodrigues as part of the Infnet Fullstack postgraduate course. It simulates an API to be consumed by [this React Application](https://github.com/MateusKurten/board-game-rental-store).

## Technologies Used

- **Node**: JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine.
- **Express**: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **jsonschema**: Library for validating JSON objects against JSON Schemas.
- **Nodemon**: Tool that helps develop Node.js applications by automatically restarting the server when file changes are detected.

## Installation

To install the required JavaScript libraries, run:

```bash
npm install
```

To start the application, run:

```bash
npm run start 
```

Some requests require authentication. To authenticate, include `userId: bmmsZ4DVir59T6aTCQ77` in the request body, or create a new user through the `user/add` endpoint and include its ID.
